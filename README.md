OBJECTIVE:

My strong passion for data analytics has driven me to undertake a project. I am working with a stakeholder who is interested in forming a cricket team for an upcoming tournament. They have requested that I suggest the best players based on their performance in the last T20 World Cup tournament. I have begun working on this project.

Process-> 

1. Data Extracting.
2. Data cleaning and transformation.
3. Data Visualization.

1. Data Extraction:

Technology used -> Python. (BeautifulSoup, requests, Pandas)

 have been conducting web scraping using Python's powerful libraries, such as BeautifulSoup and requests. I utilized the ESPN Cricinfo website to collect comprehensive data about the T20 tournament. Using pandas, I stored those insights as a dataframe for better understanding and analysis.

2.Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Technologies used -> MS Excel.

I used Microsoft Excel to clean the data in the CSV files. The cleaning process involved removing duplicates and correcting erroneous values. In Python, I established connections between tables using specific keys, which greatly facilitates the analysis process.
